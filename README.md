# Machine-Learning-at-Oxford

This repository contains my code for practicals (or projects/labs) of [Machine Learning](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/teaching/courses/2020-2021/ml/) at Oxford.
- [x] Practical 1: **Linear Regression**

  Applying linear regression (Ridge & Lasso regressions too) on the [winequality dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality). See [practical1/practical1.pdf](practical1/practical1.pdf) for details.

- [x] Practical 2 **Naive Bayes Classifiers (NBC)** v.s. **Logistic Regression (LR)**

  Comparing Naive Bayes Classifiers with Logistic Regression Classifiers. See [practical2/practical2.pdf](practical2/practical2.pdf) and paper [*On Discriminative vs. Generative Classifiers: A comparison of logistic regression and naive Bayes*](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2001/hash/7b7a53e239400a13bd6be6c91c4f6c4e-Abstract.html) for more details.
